 ‚ÑπÔ∏è | Currently we are in our closed/internal **Alpha-Testing phase**. During this time we are working on fixing the network services & functions within Home's intricate ecosystem.
:---: | :---  


    
Just with any massively multiplayer online title, our online services will go through **rigorous** development cycles/stages to ensure that once we fully release Home back to the masses, we can ensure that *most* issues are sorted out. Down below here is the following development roadmap/pipeline that we are adhering to.
    
- **1.** *Closed Alpha* - Internal testing by **Testers/Helpers** and **Developers**.
    
- **2.** *Closed Beta* [**Session 1**] - Testing by **Cache Donators** & **Nitro Boosters**.
    
    - **Closed Beta** access will be expanded in **four** incremental phases:
    
       - Phase I: 20 people.
       - Phase II: 50 people.
       - Phase III: 100 people.
       - Phase IV: All donators/boosters.
    
- **3.** *Closed Beta* [**Session 2**] -- As above but with improvements, fixes and more content added to our client.
- **4.** *Open Beta* -- Early Access available to **all members** of the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cxTqf6hS7P).
- **5.** *Official Release*  
    
‚ö†Ô∏è | Note there is no *ETA* for each stage! Developers work in their **free time** and any real-life responsibilities e.g., *college*, *work*, *family matters* will dramatically affect progress; please be patient.
